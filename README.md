# Hanabi

Hanabi is a cooperative card game by Antoine Bauza.  
The uniqueness of this game comes from players being aware of others' cards but not their own.  
The objective of the game is to play a series of cards in a specific order based on limited information received from other players.

As a topic in artificial intelligence, it has received exceptional attention as the game require players to adapt to others' playstyles and develop communication conventions.

This is a work in progress project in attempt to explore the world of reinforcement machine learning.

## Current Progress
24-25/7/2021
* Developed game environment
* Created feed forward neural network based agents
* Action sampling system
* Back propogation using gradient descent
* Reward system
* **Agents are currently able to perform all actions but are prone to playing the wrong cards**
